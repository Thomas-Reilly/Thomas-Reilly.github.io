              <p>Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was an
                American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion.
                Many consider him to be the greatest chess player of all time.
                Fischer showed great skill in chess from an early age; at 13, he
                won a brilliancy known as "The Game of the Century". At age 14,
                he became the US Chess Champion, and at 15, he became both the
                youngest grandmaster (GM) up to that time and the youngest
                candidate for the World Championship. At age 20, Fischer won the 1963–64 US Championship with 11 wins in 11 games, the only perfect score in the history of the tournament.</p>

            <td>
              <p>When playing White, Fischer virtually always opened with 1. e4.
                His victories commonly resulted from surprise attacks or
                counterattacks rather than from the accumulation of small
                advantages, yet his play remained positionally sound.</p>
              <p>Fischer’s arrogance and superior attitude led him to always
                play for a win, even when playing as black against his most
                dangerous opponents.</p>

              <p>José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera (19 November 1888 – 8 March
                1942) was a Cuban chess player who was world chess champion
                from 1921 to 1927. Born in Havana, he beat Cuban champion Juan
                Corzo in a match on 17 November 1901, two days before his
                thirteenth birthday. His victory over Frank Marshall in a match
                in 1909 earned him an invitation to the 1911 San Sebastian
                tournament, which he won. Over the next several years, Capablanca
                had a strong series of tournament results. After several
                unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match with the then world
                champion Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca finally won the title from
                Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated for eight years from 10
                February 1916 to 21 March 1924, a period which included the world
                championship match with Lasker.</p>

              <p>Naturally, there are a number of simple general characteristics
                his play has been labeled with: fantastic technique, superb
                endgame play, perfect play (also considered boring by the less
                kind).</p>
              <p>There is no question these descriptions are quite true,
                but to sum up the play of one of the greatest players of all time
                with a few pat labels would be both a great injustice and a gross
                underestimate of what lay hidden underneath.</p>

              <p>Alexander Alekhine (October 31 1892 – March 24, 1946) was a
                Russian and French chess player and the fourth World Chess
                Champion. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest chess
                players of all time. By the age of 22, Alekhine was already
                among the strongest chess players in the world. During the 1920s,
                he won most of the tournaments in which he played. In 1921,
                Alekhine left Soviet Russia and emigrated to France, which he
                represented after 1925. In 1927, he became the fourth World Chess
                Champion by defeating José Raúl Capablanca.</p>

              <p>Alekhine is known for his fierce and imaginative attacking style,
              combined with great positional and endgame skill.  Imaginative
              tactician and attacker, a true chess genius in his originality of
              thought. His ideas were rich with complexity. “His attacks came
              suddenly, like destructive thunderstorms that erupted from a clear
              blue sky” (Kasparov). He studied the openings and made many
              contributions to theory. A very difficult man to beat, it was said
              that in order to win a game from him one had to beat him 3 times,
              once in the opening, once in the middlegame and again in the
              ending.</p>
