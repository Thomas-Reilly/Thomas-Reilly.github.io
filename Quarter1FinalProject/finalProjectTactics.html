        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In chess, a tactic refers to a sequence of moves that limits the
          opponent's options and may result in tangible gain. Tactics are
          usually contrasted with strategy, in which advantages take longer to
          be realized, and the opponent is less constrained in responding. The
          fundamental building blocks of tactics are move sequences in which the
          opponent is unable to respond to all threats, so the first player
          realizes an advantage. This includes forks, skewers, batteries,
          discovered attacks, undermining, overloading, deflection, pins, and
          interference.</p>
        <p>In general, there are two categories of tactics:</p>

        <h3>Gaining Material</h3>
        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Discovered Attack</h4>
          <p>A discovered attack is a move which allows an attack by another
            piece. A piece is moved away so as to allow the attack of a friendly
             bishop, rook or queen on an enemy piece. If the attacked piece is
             the king, the situation is referred to as a discovered check.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Fork</h4>
          <p>A fork is a move that uses one piece to attack two or more of the
            opponent's pieces simultaneously, with the aim to achieve material
            advantage, since the opponent can counter only one of the threats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Pin</h4>
          <p>A pin is a move that inhibits an opponent piece from moving,
            because doing so would expose a more valuable (or vulnerable)
            piece behind it. Only bishops, rooks, and queens can perform a pin,
            since they can move more than one square in a straight line.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Skewer</h4>
          <p>A skewer is a move which attacks two pieces in a line, similar to
            a pin, except that the enemy piece of greater value is in front of
            the piece of lesser value. After the more valuable piece moves away,
            the lesser piece can be captured.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Tactics</h3>
        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Sacrifice</h4>
          <p>A sacrifice of some material is often necessary to throw the
            opponent's position out of balance, potentially gaining positional
            advantage. The sacrificed material is sometimes later offset with a
            consequent material gain.</p>

        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Zugzwang</h4>
          <p>Zugzwang (German for the "compulsion to move") occurs when a player
             is forced to make an undesirable move. The player is put at a
             disadvantage because he would prefer to pass and make no move,
             but a move has to be made, all of which weaken his position.</p>

          <img src="zugzwang.jpg" class="square"/>
        </div>
        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Zwischenzug</h4>
          <p>Zwischenzug (German for "intermediate move") is a common tactic in
            which a player under threat, instead of directly countering,
            introduces an even more devastating threat. The opponent then may
            be forced to address the new threat, abandoning the earlier attack.</p>

        <div class="section height_300 grid_5">
          <h4>Windmill</h4>
          <p>In chess, a windmill is a tactic in which a combination of
            discovered checks and regular checks, usually by a rook and a
            bishop, often forcing the opposing king to move back and forth
            between two squares, can win massive amounts of material. This
            tactic is also sometimes referred to as a see-saw.</p>
