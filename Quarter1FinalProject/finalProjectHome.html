        <p>Chess has been around for over 1400 years, and it is one of the most
          popular games in the world! The game of Chess is a two-player
          strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with
          64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The game is played by millions of
          people worldwide.</p>
        <p>Play does not involve hidden information. Each
          player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two
          knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types
          moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the
          least powerful the pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's
          king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.</p>
        <p>To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the
          opponent's pieces, while supporting each other. During the game, play
          typically involves making exchanges of one piece for an opponent's
          similar piece, but also finding and engineering opportunities to trade
          one piece for two, or to get a better position. In addition to
          checkmate, the game can be won by voluntary resignation, and there are
          also several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>

          <h3>Tactics Page</h3>
          <p>Visit the Tactics page to learn about the different tactics used in
            chess!
          <p>Studying chess tactics is one of the most important and efficient
            methods to improve your level of play.</p>
          <p>The fundamental building blocks of tactics are move sequences in
            which the opponent is unable to respond to all threats, so the first
            player realizes an advantage. This includes:</p>
          <ul class="circles">
            <li class="neat">forks</li>
            <li class="neat">skewers</li>
            <li class="neat">batteries</li>
            <li class="neat">discovered attacks</li>
            <li class="neat">undermining</li>
            <li class="neat">overloading</li>
            <li class="neat">deflection</li>
            <li class="neat">pins</li>
            <li class="neat">interference</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Encyclopedia of Chess Middlegames gives the following tactics
            categories:</p>
          <ul class="circles">
            <li class="neat">Double Attack</li>
            <li class="neat">Discovered Attack</li>
            <li class="neat">Passed Pawn</li>
            <li class="neat">X-ray Attack</li>
            <li class="neat">Interception</li>
            <li class="neat">Deflection</li>
            <li class="neat">Pin</li>
            <li class="neat">Overloading</li>
            <li class="neat">Pursuit (perpetual attack)</li>
            <li class="neat">Intermediate Move</li>
            <li class="neat">Space Clearance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While this site will cover some of these tactics, a more in depth
            study would require a significant amount of time and resources.</p>
