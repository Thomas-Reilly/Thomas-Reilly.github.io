    <p><img src="cornWoman.jpg" alt="woman looking at corn" title="a corn woman"
      height="198" width="300" align="right"/>Here is a picture of a corn woman.
      The woman is wearing a strange headset, presumably used to harvest
      the energy of the corn. The woman appears to be absorbing the corn's
      natural energy to power her headset, which will likely enable her to
      shoot lasers from her eyes. She will then use her laser eyes to subdue
      the major superpowers of the world, bending the entire planet to her
      will and slaughtering all who oppose her.</p>
