    <h1>Welcome to my web page.</h1>

    <h4>(Lets learn HTML!)</h4>

    <p>Before we start let me tell you a little about myself. This is the
      1<sup>st</sup> that I have taught this course. I was born at a very young
      age and grew in wisdom and grace until now. Of course, I hope to continue
      to grow in both wisdom and grace but that will require effort and
      attention to what is happening in the world and in myself. I hope you
      learn a lot about web programming and are enlightened by what we do
      in the class. Good luck!</p>

    <p>When writing web pages you need to make sure that you are attentive to
      lots of details like the structure and formatting of the page. I want
      to <strong>emphasize</strong> to you the importance of this.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>I want to make sure that you understand what I mean so I would like to
      quote myself.<blockquote>It is very important to be aware of all the
      small details when writing web pages. Afterall, small details can make
      a big difference. Be conscious of what you are learning and why you
      are learing it. We will certainly learn a lot in this class but we must
      always exert effort to learn</blockquote></p>
